# Astrophysical Data Analysis & Simulation â€“ Syed Tufail Hussain

This repository contains a collection of astrophysics coding projects that demonstrate methods for data processing, simulation, and visualization using Python. The projects reflect my work in analyzing real astrophysical data and modeling cosmic phenomena.

## Projects

### 1. NGC 6397 FITS Analysis
- **Purpose:** Analyze FITS data from the globular cluster NGC 6397.
- **Contents:**
  - Python scripts for reading and processing FITS files.
  - Data analysis routines and visualization code.
  - Documentation explaining the methodology and results.

### 2. White Dwarf Cooling Simulation (WD Cooling)
- **Purpose:** Simulate and analyze the cooling processes of white dwarfs.
- **Contents:**
  - Python code for modeling white dwarf cooling curves.
  - Output files, graphs, and data demonstrating simulation results.
  - Documentation outlining the simulation approach.

## How to Use
